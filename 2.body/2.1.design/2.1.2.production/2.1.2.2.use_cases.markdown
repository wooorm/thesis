### Use cases

The use cases of the target audience, the front-end developer, in the field of NLP are many. Research for this paper found several use cases, although it is expected many more could be defined. The tasks below can be categorised into three broad fields: analysation, manipulation, and creation.

- The practitioner may intent summarise natural text (mostly analysation, potentially also manipulation);
- The practitioner may intent to create natural language, e.g., displaying the number of unread messages: "You have 1 unread message," or "You have 0 unread messages" (creation);
- The practitioner may intent to recognise sentiment in text: is a Tweet positive, negative, or spam? (analysation);
- The practitioner may intent to replace so-called "dumb" punctuation with so-called "smart" punctuation, e.g., dumb quotation with (“) or (”); three dots with an ellipsis (…), or two hyphens with an en-dash (–) (manipulation);
- The practitioner may intent to count the number of certain elements in the grammatical hierarchy in a document, e.g, words, white space, punctuation, sentences, or paragraphs (analysation);
- The practitioner may intent to recognise which language a given document is written in (analysation);
- The practitioner may intent to find words based on a search term, with regards for the lemma (or stem) and/or phonetics (so that a search for "smit" also returns similar words, such as "Schmidt" or "Smith") (analysation and manipulation);

Natural Language Processing is a broad field concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, with bases in computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. NLP poses may challenges, but not every challenge challenge in the field is of interest to the web developer--the developer enabling machines to respond to humans through the world wide web.

Most importantly, the more academic areas of NLP do not fit well with the goals of web developers, e.g., speech recognition, optical character recognition, text-to-speech transformation, translation, or machine learning.
