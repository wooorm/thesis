#### Natural Language System: Retext

For natural language processing on the client side, this paper proposes Retext. Retext combines a parser, such as parse-latin or parse-dutch, with a manipulatable object model (TextOM).

In adittion, Retext provides a plugin mechanism so developers can create and publish their own plugins.
