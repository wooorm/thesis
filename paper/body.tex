\chapter{Context}\label{context}

\{\{Needs a nice quote about the definition of NLP\}\}

The focus of this paper is \gls{nlp}.
\gls{nlp} is a field related to human--computer interaction, as it
  concerns itself with enabling machines to understand human language.
Human language, a medium which is easy for humans to understand, poses
  problems for machines.

The Georgetown--\gls{ibm} experiment in 1945, one of the first application
  of \gls{nlp}, illustrates this difficulty.
During this study in New York, scientists demonstrated a
  Russian--English translation system
  \autocite{hutchins-john-georgetown-ibm-system}.
The machine translated more than sixty sentences from Russian to English.
The experiment was well publicised and resulted in optimism.
The public believed machine-translation would be a ``solved problem'' within
  three to five years.
Despite promising initial results, the following ten years proved to be
  disappointing and led to reduced funding.

Machine translation is just one of many major tasks involved with \gls{nlp}.
Other tasks include generating summaries, detecting references to people
  and places, or extracting opinion.
Tasks which are all part of \emph{information extraction}: the act of finding
  certain information in a document.
Many programs exists to carry out these and many other \gls{nlp} tasks.
The approach taken to perform these tasks are often similar between
  implementations.
Entity linking for example, is often implemented as follows
  \autocite[according to][]{stanbol-enhancer-nlp}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item\emph{Language Detection (optional)} --- Based on the language of the
    given text, the algorithms behind the following steps will change.
  Omitted if the implementation supports a single language;
\item\emph{Sentence Tokenisation (optional)} --- Sentence breaking elevates
    performance and heightens accuracy of the following stages, in
    particular \acrshort{pos} tagging;
\item\emph{Word Tokenisation} --- The entities (words) must be free from
  their surroundings;
\item\emph{\acrfull{pos} Tagging (optional)} --- It is often desired to link
    several nouns or proper nouns.
  Detecting word categories makes this achievable;
\item\emph{Noun Phrase Detection (optional)} --- Although \emph{apple} and
    \emph{juice} could be two entities, it is more appropriate to link to
    one entity: \emph{apple juice}.
  Detecting noun phrases makes this possible;
\item\emph{Lemmatisation or Stemming (optional)} --- Be it \emph{walk},
    \emph{walked}, or \emph{walking}, all forms of \emph{walk} could link
    to the same entity.
  Detecting either makes this possible;
\item\emph{Entity Linking} --- Linking detected entities to references, such
    as an encyclopaedia.
\end{enumerate}

\gls{nlp} covers many different tasks, but the process of accomplishing
  these goals touches, as seen above, on well defined stages.

\section{Scope}\label{scope}

Although many \gls{nlp} tasks exist, the standard and the implementation
  this paper proposes will only cover one: \emph{tokenisation}.
Tokenisation, as defined here, includes breaking sentences, words, and
other grammatical units.

Another confinement set to scope the proposal, is that it focusses on
  syntactic grammatical units. Thus, semantic units (i.e., phrases and
  clauses) are ignored.

In addition, the paper focusses on written language (text), thus ignoring
  spoken language.

Last, this paper focusses on Latin script languages: written languages
  using an alphabet based on the the classical Latin alphabet.

\section{Implementations}\label{implementations}

While researching algorithms to tokenise natural language few viable
  implementations were found.
Most algorithms look at either sentence- or word tokenisation (rarely both).
This section describes the current implementations, where they excel, and
  what they lack.

\subsection{Stages}\label{stages}

This section delves into how current implementations accomplish
  tokenisation tasks.

\subsubsection{Sentence tokenisation}\label{sentence-tokenisation}

Often referred to as sentence boundary disambiguation\footnote{Both
    sentence tokenisation and sentence boundary disambiguation detect
      sentences.
    Sentence boundary disambiguation focusses on the position where
      sentences break (as in, ``One sentence?\textbar{} Two
      sentences.\textbar{}'', where the pipe symbols refer to the end of
      one sentence and the beginning of another), whereas sentence
      tokenisation targets both the start and end location (as in,
      ``\{One sentence?\} \{Two sentences.\}'', where everything between
      braces is classified as a sentence).}, sentence
  tokenisation is an elementary but important part of \gls{nlp}.
It is almost always a stage in \gls{nlp} applications and not an end goal.
Sentence tokenisation makes other stages (e.g., detecting plagiarism or
  \gls{pos} tagging) perform better.

Oftentimes, sentences end in one of three symbols: either a full stop (.),
  an interrogative point (?), or an exclamation point (!)\footnote{One
    could argue the in 1962 introduced
    obscure interrobang (â€½), used to punctuate rhetorical statements where
    neither the question nor exclamation alone exactly serve the writer
    well, should be in this list \autocite{interrobang-mks.com}.}.
But detecting the boundary of a sentence is not as simple as breaking it at
  these markers: they might serve other purposes.
Full stops often occur in numbers, suffixed to abbreviations or titles,
  in initialisms\footnote{Although
    the definition of initialism is ambiguous, this paper defines its use
    as an acronym (an abbreviation formed from initial components, such as
    ``sonar'' or ``FBI'') with full stops depicting elision (such as
    ``e.g.'', or ``K.G.B.'').},
  or in embedded content\footnote{Embedded
    content in this paper refers to an external (non-grammatical) value
    embedded into a grammatical unit, such as a hyperlink or an emoticon.
    Note that these embedded values often consist of valid words and
    punctuation marks, but most always shouldn't be classified as such.}.
The interrogative- and exclamation points too can occur ambiguously, such as
  in a quote (e.g., `\,``Of course!'', she screamed').

Disambiguation gets even harder when these exceptions \emph{are} in fact a
  sentence boundary (double negative), such as in
  ``\ldots{}use the feminine form of idem, ead.'' or in
  `\,``Of course!'', she screamed, ``I'll do it!''\,', where in both
  cases the last terminal marker ends the respective sentence.

\subsubsection{Word tokenisation}\label{word-tokenisation}

Like sentence tokenisation, word tokenisation is another elementary but
important stage in \gls{nlp} applications. Whether stemming, finding
phonetics, or \gls{pos} tagging, tokenising words is an important
precursory step.

Often implementations see words as everything that is \emph{not} white
  space (i.e., spaces, tabs, feeds) and their boundaries as everything that
  is \autocite{loadfive/knwl-source-code}.

Some implementations take punctuation marks into account as boundaries.
This practice has flaws, as it results in the faulty classification of
  inter-word punctation\footnote{Many such inter-word symbols exist, such
    as hyphenation points, colons (``12:00''), or elision (whether denoted
    by full stops, ``e.g.''; apostrophes, the Dutch ``'s''; or slashes,
    ``N/A'').}
  as part of the surrounding word \autocite{NaturalNode/natural-source-code}.

\subsection{Tasks}\label{tasks}

The previous section covered implementations that solve tokenisation stages
  in \gls{nlp} applications, such as Natural's word
  tokenisers \autocite{NaturalNode/natural-source-code}.
Concluded was that these implementations are lacking.
This section covers several implementations that solve these stages
  as part of a larger task.

\subsubsection{Sentiment Analysis}\label{sentiment-analysis}

Sentiment analysis is an \gls{nlp} task concerned with the polarity
  (positive, negative) and subjectivity (objective, subjective) of text.
The implementation of sentiment analysis could look as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item\emph{Detect Language (optional)};
\item\emph{Sentence Tokenisation (optional)} --- Different sentences have
    different sentiments, tokenising them helps provide better results;
\item\emph{Word Tokenisation} --- Needed to compare with the database;
\item\emph{Lemmatisation or Stemming (optional)} --- Helps classification;
\item\emph{Sentiment Analysis}.
\end{enumerate}

Sentiment analysers typically include a
  database mapping either words, stems, or lemmas to their respective
  polarity and\slash or subjectivity\footnote{For example, the AFINN
    database mapping words to polarity \autocite{nielsen-finn-arup-afinn}.}
  and return the average sentiment per sentence, or for the whole document.
Many implementations exist for this task
  \autocites{thinkroth/sentimental-source-code}{mileszim/sediment-source-code}
  {thisandagain/sentiment-source-code}, many of which do not include
  inter-word punctuation in their \emph{definition} of words, resulting in
  less than perfect results\footnote{In fact, all found implementations
      deploy lacking tokenisations steps.
    Dubious, as they each create unreachable code through their naivety:
      all implementations remove dashes from words, while words such as
      ``self-deluded'' are included in the databases they use, but never
      reachable.}.

\subsubsection{Automatic Summarisation}\label{automatic-summarisation}

Automatic summarisation is an \gls{nlp} task concerned with the reduction
  of text to the \emph{major} points retaining the original document.
Few open source implementations of automatic summarisation algorithms on
  the web, in contrast with implementations for sentimental analysis, were
  found\footnote{For example, on the web only node-summary was found
    \autocite{jbrooksuk/node-summary-source-code}, in Scala textteaser was
    found \autocite{MojoJolo/textteaser-source-code}.}.
The implementation of automatic summarisation could look as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item\emph{Detect Language (optional)};
\item\emph{Sentence Tokenisation (optional)} --- Unless even finer grained
  control over the document is possible (tokenising phrases), sentences are
  the smallest unit that should stay intact in the resulting summary;
\item\emph{Word Tokenisation} --- Needed to calculate keywords (words
  which occur more often than expected by chance alone);
\item\emph{Automatic summarisation}.
\end{enumerate}

Automatic summarisers typically return the highest ranking units, be it
  sentences or phrases, according to several factors:

\begin{aenumerate}
\item\emph{Number of words} --- An ideal sentence is neither too long nor
  too short;
\item\emph{Number of keywords} --- Words which occur more often than
  expected by chance alone in the whole text;
\item\emph{Similarity to title} --- Number of words from the document's
  title the unit contains;
\item\emph{Position inside parent} --- Initial and final sentences of a
  paragraph are often more important than sentences buried somewhere in
  the middle.
\end{aenumerate}

Some implementations include only keyword metrics
  \autocite{jbrooksuk/node-summary-source-code}, others include all features
  \autocite{MojoJolo/textteaser-source-code}, or even more advanced factors
  \autocite{summly}.

The only implementation working on the web, by James Brook
  \autocite*{jbrooksuk/node-summary-source-code}, takes a naive sentence
  tokenisation approach.
Such as ignoring sentences terminated by exclamation marks.
Both other implementations, and many more, use a whole different approach to
  sentence tokenisation: Corpora.

\subsection{Using Corpora for NLP}\label{using-corpora-for}

A corpus is a large, structured set of texts used for many \gls{nlp}
  and linguistics tasks.
Corpora contain items (often words, but sometimes other units) annotated
  with information (such as \gls{pos} tags or lemmas).

These colossal (often more than a million words\footnote{The Brown Corpus
    contains about a million words \autocite{francis-nelson-brown-corpus},
    the Google N-Gram Corpus contains 155 billion
    \autocite{brants-thorsten-google-ngram-corpus}.})
  lumps of data are the basis of many of the newer revolutions in \gls{nlp}
  \autocite{mitkov-ruslan-ea-importance-corpora}.
Parsing based on supervised learning (in \gls{nlp}, based on annotated
  corpora), is the opposite of rule-based parsing\footnote{A simple
    rule-based sentence tokeniser could be implemented as follows
    \autocite{attivio.com-doing-things-with-sentences}:

    \begin{aenumerate}
      \item If it is a period, it ends a sentence;
      \item If the period is preceded by an abbreviation, it does not end
        a sentence;
      \item If the next token is capitalised, it ends a sentence.
    \end{aenumerate}}.
Instead of rules (and exceptions to these rules, exceptions to these
  exceptions, and so on) specified by a developer,
  supervised learning\footnote{``{[}From{]} a set of labeled examples as
    training data \ldots{} {[}, make{]} predictions for all unseen points''
    \autocite{mohri-mehryar-foundations-machine-learning}.}
  delegates this task to machines.
This delegation results in a more performant, scalable, program.

Parsing based on corpora has proven to be better in several ways over
  rule-based parsing, but the former has disadvantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Good training sets are required;
\item If the corpus was created from news articles, algorithms based on it
  will not fair so well on microblogs (e.g., Twitter posts).
\item Some rule-based approaches for pre- and post processing are still
  required;
\end{enumerate}

In addition, corpora-based parsing will not work well on the web.
Loading corpora over the network each time a user request a web page is
  unfeasible for most web sites and applications\footnote{Currently,
    one technology exists for storing large datasets in a browser: the
    \acrshort{html5} File System \acrshort{api}. However, ``work on this
    document has been discontinued'', and the specification ``should not be
    used as a basis for implementation'' \autocite{urhane-file-api}.}.

Two viable alternative approaches exist for the web: rule-based tokenisation,
  or connecting to a server over the network.

\subsection{Using a web API}\label{using-a-web}

Whereas the term \gls{api} stands for an interface between two programs,
  it is often used in web development as requests (from a web browser),
  and responses (from a web server) over \gls{http}.
For example, Twitter has such a service to allow developers to list,
  replace, create, and delete so-called tweets and other objects (users,
  images, \&c.).
This paper uses the term Web \gls{api} for the latter, and \gls{api} for
any programming interface.

With the rise of the asynchronous web\footnote{Starting around 2000,
    \gls{ajax} started to transform the web.
  Beforehand, significant changes to websites only occurred when a user
    navigated to a new page. 
  With \gls{ajax} however, new content arrived to users without the need
    for a full page refresh. One of the first examples are the Outlook Web
    App in 2000 \autocite{technet-outlook-web-access} and Gmail in 2004
    \autocite{gmailblog-gmail-ajax}, both examples of how \gls{ajax} made
    the web feel more ``app-like''.},
  supervised learning became available through web \glspl{api}
  \autocites{textteaser-web-api}{wordnet-web-api}{textrazor-web-api}.
This made it possible to use supervised learning techniques on the web,
  without needing to download corpora to a users computer.

However, accessing \gls{nlp} web \glspl{api} over a network has
  disadvantages.
Foremost of which the time involved in sending data over a network and
  bandwidth used (especially on mobile networks), and heightened security
  risks.

\chapter{Production}\label{production}

\section{Target Audience}\label{target-audience}

The audience that benefits the most from the proposal, are web developers.
Web developers are programmers who specialise in creating software that
  functions on the world wide web.
A group which enables machines to respond to humans.
They engage in client side development (building the interface between
  a human and a machine on the web), and sometimes also in server side
  development (building the interface between the client side and a
  server).

Typical areas of work consist of programming in \gls{ecmascript},
  marking up documents in \gls{html}, graphic design through \gls{css},
  creating a back end in Node.js, \gls{php}, or other platforms, contacting a
  \gls{mongodb}, \gls{mysql}, or other database, and more.

Additionally, many interdisciplinary skills, such as usability,
  accessibility, copywriting, information architecture, or optimisation,
  are also of concern to web developers.

\section{Use cases}\label{use-cases}

The use cases of the target audience, the web developer, in the field of
  \gls{nlp} are many.
Research for this paper found several use cases, although it is
  expected many more could be defined.
The tasks below are each categorised into broad, generic fields: analysation,
  manipulation, and creation.

\begin{aenumerate}
\item The developer may intent to summarise natural text (mostly analysation,
  potentially also manipulation);
\item The developer may intent to create natural language, e.g., displaying
  the number of unread messages: ``You have 1 unread message,'' or ``You
  have 0 unread messages'' (creation);
\item The developer may intent to recognise sentiment in text: is a
  \emph{tweet} positive, negative, or spam? (analysation);
\item The developer may intent to replace so-called \emph{dumb} punctuation
  with \emph{smart} punctuation, such as dumb quotations with (``) or (''),
  three dots with an ellipsis (\ldots{}), or two hyphens with an en-dash
  (--) (manipulation);
\item The developer may intent to count the number of certain grammatical
  units in a document, such as, words, white space, punctuation, sentences,
  or paragraphs (analysation);
\item The developer may intent to recognise the language in which a document
  is written (analysation);
\item The developer may intent to find words in a document based on a search
  term, with regards for the lemma (or stem) and\slash or phonetics (so that
  a search for ``smit'' also returns similar words, such as ``Schmidt'' or
  ``Smith'') (analysation and manipulation).
\end{aenumerate}

\gls{nlp} is a large field with many challenges, but not every challenge in
  the field is of interest to the web developer.
Foremost, the more academic areas of \gls{nlp}, such as speech recognition,
  optical character recognition, text-to-speech transformation, translation,
  and machine learning, do not fit well with the goals of web developers.

\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}

The proposal must enable the target audience to reach the in the previous
  section defined use cases.
In addition, the proposal should meet several other requirements to better
  suit the wishes of the target audience.

\subsection{Open Source}\label{open-source}

To reach the target audience and validate its usability, the proposal
  should be open source.
All code should be licensed under \acrshort{mit}, a license which
  provides rights for others to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
  distribute, sublicense, and\slash or sell copies of the code it covers.

In addition, the software should be developed under the all-seeing eye of
  the community: GitHub.
GitHub is a hosted version control\footnote{Version
    control services manage revisions to documents, popularly used for
    controlling and tracking changes in software.} service with social
  networking features.
On GitHub, web developers follow their peers to track what they are
  working on, watch their favourite projects to get notified of changes,
  and raise issues and feature requests.

\subsection{Performance}\label{performance}

The in this paper proposed implementations were produced with high
regards for performance. Performance includes the software having a
small file size in order to reach the client over the network with the
highest possible speed, but most importantly that the execution of code
should operate efficiently and at at high speeds.

\subsection{Testing}\label{testing}

With the development of the in this paper introduced software, testing
was given high priority. Testing, in software development, refers to
validating if software does what it is supposed to do, and can be
divided into multiple subgroups:

\begin{aenumerate}
\item
  Unit testing --- Validation of each specific section of code;
\item
  Integration testing --- Validation of how programs work together;
\item
  System testing --- Validation of if system meets its requirements;
\item
  Acceptance testing --- Validation of the end product.
\end{aenumerate}

Great care was given to develop a full test suite with full coverage for
every program. Coverage, in software development, is a term used to
describe the amount of code tested by the test suite: full coverage
means every part of the code is reached by the tests.

Unit test were run through Mocha
\autocite{visionmedia/mocha-source-code}, coverage was detected with
Istanbul \autocite{gotwarlost/istanbul-source-code}.

\subsection{Code quality}\label{code-quality}

Great attention was given to code quality: how useful and readable for
both humans and machines the software is. Special focus was given to
consistency and clearness for humans.

\subsubsection{Suspicious Code and Bugs}\label{suspicious-code-and-bugs}

To detect bugs and suspicious code in the software, Eslint
\autocite{eslint/eslint-source-code} was used. The act of linting, in
computer programming, is a term used to describe static code analysis to
detect syntactic discrepancies without actually running the code. Eslint
was used because it provides a solid basic set of rules and enables
developers to create custom rules.

\subsubsection{Style}\label{style}

To enforce a consistent code style, in order to create software readable
for humans, \gls{jscs} was used
\autocite{mdevils/node-jscs-source-code}. \gls{jscs} provides rules for
allowing or disallowing patters such as white space at the end of a line
or camel cased variable names, or setting a maximum line length.
\gls{jscs} was chosen because it, just like the aforementioned Eslint,
provides a strong base set of rules. The rules chosen for the
development of the proposed software was set very strict to enforce all
code was written in the same manner.

\subsubsection{Commenting}\label{commenting}

Even when code is completely bug free, uses no hard-to-understand
shortcuts, and adheres to a strict style, it might still be hard to
understand for humans. The act of commenting code---describing what a
program does and why it accomplishes this in a certain way---is
important. On the other hand, commenting can also be to verbose, for
example when the code is duplicated in natural language.

\gls{jsdoc} \autocite{google.com-clojure-compiler-jsdoc} is a markup
language for \gls{ecmascript} programs, allowing developers to embed
documentation in source code. Later various tools can be used to extract
the documentation and expose it separately from the original code.

Great care was given to annotate ``tricky'' source code inside the
software with comments, and to apply documentation inside the source
code through \gls{jsdoc}.

\subsection{Automation}\label{automation}

Great focus was given to develop using several automated \gls{ci}
environments. When suspicious, ambiguous, or buggy code was introduced
in the software, the error was automatically detected and in some cases
deployment was prevented.

Tools user were Code Climate \autocite{codeclimate.com} to detect
complex, duplicate, or bug-prone code, and Travis
\autocite{travis-ci.org} to validate all unit tests passed before
deploying the software.

\subsection{API Design}\label{design-1}

Interface design was given high priority for the development of the
proposed software. A clear interface of the software, according to
Joshua Bloch \autocite*{bloch-joshua-how-design-good-api-why-matters},
has the following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Easy to learn;
\item
  Easy to use;
\item
  Hard to misuse;
\item
  Easy to read;
\item
  Easy to maintain;
\item
  Easy to extend;
\item
  Meeting its requirements;
\item
  Appropriate for the target audience.
\end{enumerate}

In essence equal but worded differently are the characteristics of good
\gls{api} design according to the Qt Project
\autocite{qt-project.org-api-design-principles}, are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Be minimal;
\item
  Be complete;
\item
  Have clear and simple semantics;
\item
  Be intuitive;
\item
  Be easy to memorise;
\item
  Lead to readable code.
\end{enumerate}

With the creation of the software these characteristics, and the in
their sources given examples, were taken into account.

\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}

Access both on the client side and on the server side to the software
was of importance during the development of the software. For the server
side on Node.js, \gls{npm}---the default package manager for the platform---is
the most popular. On the client side, many different package managers
exist, the most popular\footnote{Popularity here is simply defined as
  having the most search results on Google.} being Bower and Component.
To reach the target audience, in addition of making the whole source
available for download through Git and GitHub, \gls{npm}, Bower, and Component
were used.

\chapter{Design \& Architecture}\label{design}

The in this paper proposed solution to the problem of \gls{nlp} on the
client side is split up in multiple small proposals. Each proposal
solves a subproblem.

\begin{aenumerate}
\item
  \gls{nlcst} --- Defines a standard for classifying grammatical units
  understandable for machines;
\item
  Parse-latin --- Classifies natural language according to \gls{nlcst};
\item
  \gls{textom} --- Provides an interface for analysing and manipulating
  output provided by parse-latin;
\item
  Retext --- Provides an interface for transforming natural language
  into an object model and exposes an interface for plugins.
\end{aenumerate}

The decoupled approach taken by the provided solution enables other
developers to provide their own software to replace one of the
sub-proposals. For example, other parties can create a parser for the
Chinese language and use it instead of parse-latin to classify natural
language according to \gls{nlcst}.

\section{Syntax: NLCST}\label{syntax}

To develop natural language tools in \gls{ecmascript}, an intermediate
representation of natural language is useful: instead of each module
defining their own representation of text, using a single syntax leads
to better results, interoperability, and performance.

The elements defined by \gls{nlcst} (Natural Language Concrete Syntax
Tree) are based on the the grammatical hierarchy, but by default do not
expose all its constituents\footnote{The grammatical hierarchy of text
  is constituted by words, phrases, clauses, and sentences.
  \glspl{nlcst} only implements the sentence and word constituents by
  default, although clauses and phrases could be provided by
  implementations.}. Additionally, more elements are provided to cover
other semantic units in natural language\footnote{Most notably,
  punctuation, symbol, and white space elements.}.

The definitions of exposed nodes were heavily based on other
specifications of syntax trees for manipulation on the web platform,
such as CSS, aptly named for the \acrshort{css} language
\autocite{reworkcss/css-source-code} or the Mozilla JavaScript
\acrshort{ast}, for \gls{ecmascript}
\autocite{mozilla.org-spidermonkey-parser_api}. Both implementations are
widely used. CSS by Rework \autocite{reworkcss/rework-source-code}, and
Mozilla JavaScript \gls{ast} by Esprima
\autocite{ariya/esprima-source-code}, Acorn
\autocite{marijnh/acorn-source-code}, and Escodegen
\autocite{constellation/escodegen-source-code}.

Note that the aforementioned syntax tree specifications are both
\glspl{ast}, whereas \gls{nlcst} is a a \gls{cst}. A concrete syntax
tree is a one-to-one mapping of source to result. All information stored
in the original input is also available through the resulting tree
\autocite{thegreenplace.net-abstract-concrete-syntax-trees}.

The information stored in \glspl{cst} is very verbose and could lead to
trees that are hard to work with. On the other hand, the fact that every
part of the input is housed in the tree, makes it easy for developers to
save the output or pass it on to other libraries for further processing.

\medskip \noindent See appendix~\ref{apendix-a-nlcst-definition} on
page~\pageref{apendix-a-nlcst-definition} for a complete list of
specified nodes of \gls{nlcst}.

\section{Parser: Parse-latin}\label{parser-parse-latin}

\gls{ecmascript} is used extensively. Because of this, many \gls{ecmascript}
tools are being developed. This includes tools for Natural Language
Processing. These \gls{ecmascript} tools however, when run on the client-side,
can not implement supervised learning based on corpora, and web
\gls{api} usage too is not ideal. Thus, a rule-based parser is needed to
tokenise text.

For creating such intermediate representations from Latin-script based
languages, parse-latin is presented in this paper\footnote{Whether
  Old-English, Icelandic, French, or even scripts slightly similar, such
  as Cyrillic, Georgian, or Armenian.}. As proof-of-concept, two other
libraries are also presented, parse-english and parse-dutch, using
parse-latin as a base and providing better support for several language
specific features, respectively English and Dutch.

By following \glspl{nlcst}, modules building on parse-latin may receive
better results or performance over implementing their own parsing tools.

By using the \gls{cst} as described by \gls{nlcst} and the parser as
described by parse-latin, the intermediate representation can be used by
developers to create independent modules.

Basically, parse-latin splits text into white space, word, and
punctuation tokens. parse-latin starts out with a pretty simple
definition, one that most other tokenisers use:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  A ``word'' is one or more letter or number characters;
\item
  A ``white space'' is one or more white space characters;
\item
  A ``punctuation'' is one or more of anything else.
\end{enumerate}

Then, it manipulates and merges those tokens into a syntax tree, adding
sentences and paragraphs where needed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Some punctuation marks are part of the word they occur in, e.g.,
  ``non-profit'', ``she's'', ``G.I.'', ``11:00'', ``N\slash A'';
\item
  Some full-stops do not mark a sentence end, e.g., ``1.'', ``e.g.'',
  ``id.'';
\item
  Although full-stops, question marks, and exclamation marks (sometimes)
  end a sentence, that end might not occur directly after the mark,
  e.g., ``.)'', ``.'{}''.
\end{enumerate}

See appendix~\ref{appendix-b-parse-latin-output} on
page~\pageref{appendix-b-parse-latin-output} for example output provided
by the parse-latin parser.

\subsection{parse-english}\label{parse-english}

parse-english has the same interface as parse-latin, but returns results
better suited for English natural language. For example:

\begin{aenumerate}
\item
  Unit abbreviations (``tsp.'', ``tbsp.'', ``oz.'', ``ft.'', \&c.);
\item
  Time references (``sec.'', ``min.'', ``tues.'', ``thu.'', ``feb.'',
  \&c.);
\item
  Business Abbreviations (``Inc.'' and ``Ltd.'');
\item
  Social titles (``Mr.'', ``Mmes.'', ``Sr.'', \&c.);
\item
  Rank and academic titles (``Dr.'', ``Rep.'', ``Gen.'', ``Prof.'',
  ``Pres.'', \&c.);
\item
  Geographical abbreviations (``Ave.'', ``Blvd.'', ``Ft.'', ``Hwy.'',
  \&c.);
\item
  American state abbreviations (``Ala.'', ``Minn.'', ``La.'', ``Tex.'',
  \&c.);
\item
  Canadian province abbreviations (``Alta.'', ``QuÃ©.'', ``Yuk.'',
  \&c.);
\item
  English county abbreviations (``Beds.'', ``Leics.'', ``Shrops.'',
  \&c.);
\item
  Common elision (omission of letters) (``\,`n'\,'', ``'o'', ``'em'',
  ``'twas'', ``'80s'', \&c.).
\end{aenumerate}

\subsection{parse-dutch}\label{parse-dutch}

parse-dutch has, just like parse-english, the same interface as
parse-latin, but returns results better suited for Dutch natural
language. For example:

\begin{aenumerate}
\item
  Unit and time abbreviations (``gr.'', ``sec.'', ``min.'', ``ma.'',
  ``vr.'', ``vrij.'', ``febr'', ``mrt'', \&c.);
\item
  Many other common abbreviations: (``Mr.'', ``Mv.'', ``Sr.'', ``Em.'',
  ``bijv.'', ``zgn.'', ``amb.'', \&c.);
\item
  Common elision (omission of letters) (``d''', ``'n'', ``'ns'', ``'t'',
  ``'s'', ``'er'', ``'em'', ``'ie'', \&c.).
\end{aenumerate}

\section{Object Model: TextOM}\label{object-model}

To modify \gls{nlcst} nodes in \gls{ecmascript}, this paper proposes
\gls{textom}. \gls{textom} implements the nodes defined by \gls{nlcst},
but provides an object-oriented style\footnote{Object-oriented
  programming is a style of programming, where classes, instances,
  attributes, and methods are important.}. \gls{textom} was designed to
  be similar to the \gls{dom}\footnote{See appendix~\ref{appendix-c-dom} on
  page~\pageref{appendix-c-dom} for a more
  information on the \gls{dom}.}, the mechanism used by browsers to
expose \gls{html} through \gls{ecmascript} to developers. Because of
\glspl{textom} likeness to the \gls{dom}, \gls{textom} is easy to learn
and familiar to the target audience.

\gls{textom} provides events (a mechanism for detecting changes),
modification functionality (inserting, removing, and replacing children
into\slash from parents), and traversal (e.g., finding all words in a
sentence).

\gls{nlcst} allows authors to extend the specification by defining their
own nodes, for example creating phrase or clause nodes. \gls{textom}
allows for the same extension, and is build to work well with
``unknown'' node types.

\section{Natural Language System:
Retext}\label{natural-language-system-retext}

For natural language processing on the client side, this paper proposes
Retext. Retext combines a parser, such as parse-latin or parse-dutch,
with a manipulatable object model (\gls{textom}).

In addition, Retext provides a minimalistic plugin mechanism so
developers can create and publish plugins for others, and in turn can
use others' plugins inside their projects.

\chapter{Validation}\label{validation}

The developed software was validated through two approaches. The design
and usability of the interface was validated by trying to solve the use
cases with the software. If the target audience actually wanted to use
the software was validated through enthusiasm showed by the open source
community.

\section{Plugins}\label{plugins}

More than fifteen (15) Retext plugins were created to validate how the
different projects integrated together, and how the system worked as a
whole.

The created plugins include tools for:

\begin{aenumerate}
\item
  Transforming so-called dumb punctuation marks into more
  typographically correct punctuation marks
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-smartypants-source-code};
\item
  Transforming emoji short-codes (:cat:) into real emoji
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-emoji-source-code};
\item
  Detecting the direction of text
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-directionality-source-code};
\item
  Detecting phonetics
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-double-metaphone-source-code};
\item
  Detecting the stem of words
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-porter-stemmer-source-code};
\item
  Detecting grammatical units
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-visit-source-code};
\item
  Finding text, even misspelled
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-search-source-code};
\item
  Detecting \gls{pos} tags
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-pos-source-code};
\item
  Finding keywords and -phrases
  \autocite*{wooorm/retext-keywords-source-code}.
\end{aenumerate}

The creation of these plugins brought several problems to light in the
developed software. These problems were then dealt with back and forth
between the software and the plugins. The software changed severely by
these fixed problems, which resulted in a more useable interface.

\section{Reception}\label{reception}

To validate if the target audience actually wanted to use the developed
software, several blogs and email newsletters were contacted to feature
Retext, either in the form of an article or as a simple link.

This resulted in several mentions on blogs
\autocite{dailyjs.com-natural-language-parsing-retext}, link roundups
\autocites[e.g., ][]{github.com-awesome-machine-learning}
{github.com-awesome-nodejs}, reddit  \autocites[e.g., ][]
{reddit.com-mention-1}{reddit.com-mention-2}{reddit.com-mention-3}. In turn,
these publications resulted in positive reactions, such as on Twitter
\autocites{twitter.com-mention-1}{twitter.com-mention-2}
{twitter.com-mention-3}{twitter.com-mention-4}{twitter.com-mention-5},
feedback \autocites{github.com-issue-1}{github.com-issue-2}, and fixes
\autocite{github.com-pull-request}. In addition, many web developers started
following the project on GitHub \autocite{github.com-stargazers}.
