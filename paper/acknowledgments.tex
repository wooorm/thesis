  \chapter*{Acknowledgments \& Dedication}

  \itshape
  Thanks to my supervisor Justus\,Sturkenboom for the\,trust (and
    the patience) in me and my work, and for allowing me to produce
    a\,product I\,am pleased with.

  \medskip
  \noindent In addition, thanks go out to the open\,source community,
    especially those who raised issues or submitted pull request, and those
    who have not done so yet, but will.

  \medskip
  \noindent This thesis is dedicated to both Jelmer and Errol, who departed
    this happy life too early.
