  \chapter*{Acknowledgments \& Dedication}

  \itshape
  Thanks to my supervisor Justus Sturkenboom for the trust (and the patience)
    in me and my work, and for allowing me to produce a product I'm pleased
    with.

  \medskip
  \noindent In addition, thanks go out to the open source community,
    especially those who raised issues, submitted pull request, and those
    who haven't done so yet, but will in the future.

  \medskip
  \noindent This thesis is dedicated to Jelmer, who departed this happy live
    too early.
