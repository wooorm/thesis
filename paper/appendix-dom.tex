\chapter{DOM}\label{appendix-dom}

The \gls{dom} specification defines a platform-neutral model for errors,
  events, and (for this paper, the primary feature) node trees.
\acrshort{xml}-based documents can be represented by the \gls{dom}.

Consider the following \gls{html} document:

\begin{lstlisting}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class=e>
    <head><title>Aliens?</title></head>
    <body>Why yes.</body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Is represented by the \gls{dom} as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
|- Document
   |- Doctype: html
   |- Element: html class="e"
      |- Element: head
      |  |- Element: title
      |     |- Text: Aliens?
      |- Text: "\n "
      |- Element: body
        |- Text: "Why yes.\n"
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The \gls{dom} interfaces of bygone times were widely considered
  horrible, but newer features seem to be gaining popularity in the web
  authoring community as broader implementation across user agents is reached.
