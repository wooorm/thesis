\chapter*{Executive Summary}

\gls{nlp} covers many tasks, but the process of accomplishing
  these goals touches on well-defined stages
  (§ \ref{natural-language-processing},
  p. \pageref{natural-language-processing}).
Such as \emph{tokenisation}, the focus of the proposal.
Current implementations on the web platform are lacking
  (§ \ref{implementations}, p. \pageref{implementations}).
In part, because advanced machine learning techniques (such as
  \emph{supervised learning}) do not work on the web
  (§ \ref{using-corpora-for}, p. \pageref{using-corpora-for}).

The audience that benefits the most from better parsing on the web platform,
  are web developers, a group which is more interested in practical use, and
  less so in theoretical applications
  (§ \ref{target-audience}, p. \pageref{target-audience}).

The target audience's use cases for \gls{nlp} on the web are vast. Examples
  include automatic summarisation, sentiment recognition, spam detection,
  typographic enhancements, counting words, language recognition, and more
  (§ \ref{use-cases}, p. \pageref{use-cases}).

The presented proposal is split into several smaller solutions.
These solutions come together in a proposal: \emph{Retext}, a complete
  natural language system (§ \ref{design}, p. \pageref{design}).
\emph{Retext} takes care of parsing natural language and enables users to
  create and use plug-ins (§ \ref{natural-language-system-retext},
  p. \pageref{natural-language-system-retext}).

Parsing is delegated to \emph{parse-latin} and others, which first tokenise
  text into a list of words, punctuation, and white space. Later, these
  tokens are parsed into a syntax tree, containing paragraphs, sentences,
  embedded content, and more. Their intellect extends several well known
  techniques (§ \ref{parser-parse-latin}, p. \pageref{parser-parse-latin}).

The objects returned by \emph{parse-latin} and others are defined by
  \acrshort{nlcst}. \acrshort{nlcst} defines the syntax for these objects.
  \acrshort{nlcst} is designed in similarity to other popular syntax tree
  specifications (§ \ref{syntax}, p. \pageref{syntax}).

The interface to analyse and manipulate these object is implemented by
  \gls{textom}. \gls{textom} is created in similarity to other, for the target
  audience well known, techniques
  (§ \ref{object-model}, p. \pageref{object-model}).

The proposal was validated both by solving the audience's use cases with
  \emph{Retext}, and by measuring the audience's enthusiasm for \emph{Retext}.
Use cases were validated by implementing many as plug-ins for
  \emph{Retext} (§ \ref{plugins}, p. \pageref{plugins}).
The enthusiasm showed by the target audience on social networks, through
  e-mail, and social coding was positive
  (§ \ref{reception}, p. \pageref{reception}).
