## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP), a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages [@wikipedia-natural-language-processing], is becoming increasingly important in society. For example, search engines try to answer before a question is given, the NSA detects terrorist-toned motifs in text messages, and e-mail applications know if a user forgot to attach an attachment.

However, to date, web developers trying to solve NLP problems reinvent the wheel over and over again. There are certainly tools (especially for other platforms. such as Python [@nltk-source] and Java [@opennlp-source]) trying to solve this, but they either take a too naive approach[^introduction-1], or try to do everything out of the box[^introduction-2]. What is missing is a standard for multipurpose natural language analysisâ€”a standard representation of the grammatical hierarchy of text.

For over a year I too have camped with the previously mentioned problem. I have tried to solve it, to no avail, on numerous occasions. During the creation of this thesis I developed a well thought out and substantiated solution, which solves the previously mentioned problems.
